# 🍕 DC Pizza Order Tracker

This project tracks pizza orders around government buildings in the Washington, DC area. Inspired by the legendary pizza tracker stories, this application aims to gather and visualize order data near key locations in the nation's capital.

## 📊 What It Does
- **Tracks Pizza Orders:** Monitors pizza deliveries near government buildings.
- **Data Storage:** Stores collected data in a CSV file.
- **Insight Generation:** Offers insight into possible trends and events based on pizza order patterns.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Collects data from Google Business busy scores.
2. Parses and processes the data (though formatting could use some improvement).
3. Stores the new data in a CSV file.

## 🚧 Current State
- The data isn’t formatted perfectly yet. Expect quirks and inconsistencies.
- Visualization methods are basic but functional.

## 💡 Contributing
- **Pull Requests Welcome:** Help improve data parsing, CSV storage, or any other aspect.
- **Issues:** Feel free to report bugs or suggest features.
